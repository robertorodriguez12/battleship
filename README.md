# This is Nell and Roberto's game of Battleship. Enjoy!

## Our goals were:
- to create an interactive game that lets a human play against an AI
- to make the AI sassy
- to generate randomness and integrate user input
- to create functional objects that interact across classes
- to render a game board that registered ship objects and their conditions

## Some of our challenges:
- referencing object functionality across classes
- figuring out a productive workflow
- how to create objects inside classes
- how to fine tune the functionality of the game
- fixing bugs and then making more bugs!

## What we learned:
- got more practice building on the concepts in the solo project
- lots about classes, objects, methods
- how to write longer Boolean statements
- how to create an interactive game
